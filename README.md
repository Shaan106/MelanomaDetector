This is an implementation is from complete scratch using only logistic nodes. Yes I know CNNs are better, I just didn't know much about them when I made this (I do now). The implementation of the classification NN is pretty cool so do have a look. The PDF is for those who want to look at the code but not run it (recommended as the algorithm does require a LOT to run)
